  "comment_desc": "this game is the best game I have ever played in a mobile device and it is such a shame for it to end like this. The game had very good gameplay/gunplay and the champions and the movement in the game just make it even better. The only few problem in the game that I had were bots a lot of them in pubs and a few even in pred rank, few bugs and some cheaters here and there. Many people complain about the in game purchases but it is not nearly bad as PUBG,CODM, and other mobile games. It still does cost alot of money but compared to the other games it is not as bad. The game only has some days left before it shuts down but if you want to download it you should cuz it a fantastic game. Really hope the game somehow revives itself but the chances are slim . RIP APEX MOBILE (#SAVEAPEXMOBILE)",
